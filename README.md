# Sales Prediction System using Amazon SageMaker

This project is a machine learning application built using AWS SageMaker to predict product sales based on business parameters such as month, advertisement spend, and discount percentage.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The model is trained using historical sales data and a Linear Regression algorithm to forecast future sales. The trained model is deployed in the cloud for real-time prediction.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Amazon SageMaker
- AWS S3
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains:
- Month
- Advertising Spend
- Discount Percentage
- Sales

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm: Linear Regression
- Input: Month, Ads, Discount
- Output: Predicted Sales

## 🏗 Architecture
Data → S3 → SageMaker → ML Model → Predictions

## 🧪 Sample Prediction
Input:
Month = 6  
Ads = 8000  
Discount = 30  

Output:
Predicted Sales ≈ 640
